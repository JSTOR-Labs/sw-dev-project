# JSTOR Labs software developer project - Linked Open Data

## Project description

The project assignment is to develop a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that uses data queried from the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) knowledge graph to generate table(s) and/or other visualization(s) from the queried data.  The subject of the data queried and resulting output is completely open and can be anything from the serious to the whimsical.

It is expected that the project would require approximately 4 hours of effort.  The output will be a single jupyter notebook that will be shared with us via a [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) link to an executable version of the notebook.  The notebook should include any necessary documentation to describe the subject of the query and the steps involved in going from your general idea to the generated output.  The [included example](wikidata-example.ipynb) can be used for general guidance.

## Project specific background

### Wikidata

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) is an open knowledge graph consisting of nearly 90 million entities.  Wikidata has rapidly become one of the largest and most important repositories of Linked Open Data [(LOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) in the evolution of the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) first described by Tim Berners-Lee in 1999.  The semantic web envisions the internet as more than just human readable web pages but as a global database of semantic data that can also be consumed by machines.  Wikidata provides a [public endpoint](https://query.wikidata.org/) through which [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) queries are submitted to obtain results.

In considering a subject for the project the queries on the [Wikidata examples](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries/examples) page might be useful as both a source of inspiration and some working SPARQL syntax samples.
